Mas a vida é mesmo uma diminuição das possibilidades. As pessoas têm sempre de escolher e quando escolhem, perdem sempre alguma coisa.</i> – Vasco Pulido Valente (2000)</p>

      <p><i>This confusion of fundamental values with superficial tastes is one of the strangest but most important fetishes of globalization. In reality non-Westerners superficially emulate Westerners and sometimes have as much money as Westerners. They use the same technology as Westerners. They echo the same political sloganeering as Westerners. Yet they are hardly political Westerners at all.</i> – Victor Davis Hanson, The Dying Citizen (2021)</p>

      <p><i>Living in a modest studio in Paris, Czapski was producing paintings saturated with light and color into his late eighties.

But that 'almost nothing' signifies everything".</i> – John Gray, The New Leviathans (2023)</p>

It works using the peak shift principle, that is, take a stimulus that produces a certain response and then exaggerate its critical features to exaggerate the response.</i> – Anjan Chatterjee, The Aesthetic Brain (2013)</p>
      <p><i>Humans are primarily driven by their emotions. Jonathan Haidt uses the metaphor of an elephant and its rider to describe how the human mind works. The elephant represents the emotion part of the human brain. It makes most of the decisions. The rider represents the rational part of the brain. It can sometimes influence the elephant, but it mostly provides justifications for the elephant's decisions.</i> – Chris Richardson, Microservices Patterns (2018)</p>
      <p><i>Chico pensa na utilidade «prática». Mas, se através dos tempos o homem pensasse apenas na utilidade prática, hoje não seria um homem, seria um parafuso.
