      <p><i>“Ah, it’s you!” said Pierre with a preoccupied, dissatisfied air. “And I, you see, am hard at it,” he pointed to his manuscript-book with that air of escaping from the ills of life with which unhappy people look at their work.</i> – Leo Tolstoy (1869), War and Peace</p>
      <p><i>It doesn't matter how fast you're going, if you're going in the wrong direction.</i> – Seth Godin</p>

      <p><i>The vastness of the USA, combined with its great social mobility, has always encouraged people to uproot themselves from failed lives and start out again somewhere else. In the past, Britain’s smallness and its settled class system have compelled us to be polite, restrained and repressed, or face chaos. Japan’s elaborate manners and customs are a similar response to living at close quarters on cramped islands.</i> – Peter Hitchens, The Abolition of Britain (2018)</p>
      <p><i>It is a great folly to hope that other men will harmonize with us. I have never hoped this. I have always regarded each man as an independent individual, whom I endeavored to understand with all his peculiarities, but from whom I desired no further sympathy. In this way have I been enabled to converse with every man, and thus alone is produced the knowledge of various characters and the dexterity necessary for the conduct of life.</i> – Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</p>
      <p><i>“E tu, o que é que vais fazer?” Acompanhei-a à porta: de facto, dei-me conta de que não tinha a mais pequena ideia. Beijei-a suavemente nos lábios e respondi: “Não há um Israel para mim.” Um pensamento pobre, mas exato. Depois, ela desapareceu no elevador.</i> – Michel Houellebecq, Submissão (2015)</p>
      <p><i>Querer pelo desejo o que sabe não poder querer pela vontade.</i> – José Saramago</p>

      <p><i>Sempre pensei na vida como se fosse um funil. As pessoas começam nas bordas do funil, têm imensas possibilidades e depois, à medida que envelhecem, o círculo é cada vez mais pequeno, até que saem pelo cano fora… As possibilidades estão todas lá, ao princípio. Mas a vida é mesmo uma diminuição das possibilidades. As pessoas têm sempre de escolher e quando escolhem, perdem sempre alguma coisa.</i> – Vasco Pulido Valente (2000)</p>
      <p><i>No início do século XVI difundiu-se em Portugal o uso do azulejo com padrões tipicamente hispano-mouriscos, produzidos em Sevilha e Toledo. A sua estética veicula o horror ao vazio.</i> – Museu do Azulejo</p>
      <p><i>To die is nothing; but it is terrible not to live.</i> – Victor Hugo</p>

      <p><i>You can't get rid of your fears; but you can learn to live with them.</i></p>
      <p><i>Vera was good-looking, not at all stupid, quick at learning, was well brought up, and had a pleasant voice; what she said was true and appropriate, yet, strange to say, everyone — the visitors and countess alike — turned to look at her as if wondering why she had said it, and they all felt awkward.</i> – Leo Tolstoy (1869), War and Peace</p>
      <p><i>This confusion of fundamental values with superficial tastes is one of the strangest but most important fetishes of globalization. In reality non-Westerners superficially emulate Westerners and sometimes have as much money as Westerners. They use the same technology as Westerners. They echo the same political sloganeering as Westerners. Yet they are hardly political Westerners at all.</i> – Victor Davis Hanson, The Dying Citizen (2021)</p>
      <p><i>Primum non nocere</i> – Latin phrase, "first, do no harm"</p>
      <p><i>O princípio que o trabalho é objeto de uma construção, de um tornar-se; e não objeto de uma essência, de um ser.</i> – José Nuno Matos, O operário em construção (2015)</p>

      <p><i>Living in a modest studio in Paris, Czapski was producing paintings saturated with light and color into his late eighties. Asked why his work featured "lonely people, deserted café tables, faces half concealed in the metro, minute daily events glimpsed in passing", he replied: "Each time, it is almost nothing. But that 'almost nothing' signifies everything".</i> – John Gray, The New Leviathans (2023)</p>
      <p><i>We cannot live with that awareness of the future always in our minds; uncertainty and hope are as essential to man as breath.</i> – Judith Starkston</p>
      <p><i>We might call this the “rubber band theory” of personality. We are like rubber bands at rest. We are elastic and can stretch ourselves, but only so much.</i> – Susan Cain, Quiet (2013)</p>
      <p><i>Tomada de consciência da pequenez e da grandeza do homem era como Kant definia o efeito causado pelo sublime, porque o infinito esmaga-nos, mas o pensamento sobre o infinito eleva-nos, de modo que o sentimento do sublime provoca, em simultâneo, dor, medo e prazer.</i> – Pierre Hadot, Não Te Esqueças de Viver (2019)</p>
      <p><i>Junk food capitalizes on our evolutionary predispositions for sugar and fat. It works using the peak shift principle, that is, take a stimulus that produces a certain response and then exaggerate its critical features to exaggerate the response.</i> – Anjan Chatterjee, The Aesthetic Brain (2013)</p>
      <p><i>Humans are primarily driven by their emotions. Jonathan Haidt uses the metaphor of an elephant and its rider to describe how the human mind works. The elephant represents the emotion part of the human brain. It makes most of the decisions. The rider represents the rational part of the brain. It can sometimes influence the elephant, but it mostly provides justifications for the elephant's decisions.</i> – Chris Richardson, Microservices Patterns (2018)</p>
      <p><i>Chico pensa na utilidade «prática». Mas, se através dos tempos o homem pensasse apenas na utilidade prática, hoje não seria um homem, seria um parafuso. De resto, os utilitários estão lutando contra si: conquistada a base prática, liquidados, em hipótese, os problemas de bem-estar, forçada toda a azáfama ao silêncio, eis que as flores da solidão, da asfixia, brotarão com a sua virulência clandestina da miséria do homem: a vida estará então toda ela por conquistar, desde o limiar das origens.</i> – Vergílio Ferreira, Aparição (1959)</p>
      <p><i>A man who is born into a world already possessed, if he cannot get subsistence from his parents on whom he has a just demand, and if the society do not want his labour, has no claim of right to the smallest portion of food, and, in fact, has no business to be where he is. At nature’s mighty feast there is no vacant cover for him. She tells him to be gone, and will quickly execute her own orders, if he does not work upon the compassion of some of her guests.</i> – Thomas Robert Malthus, An Essay on the Principle of Population (1798)</p>
      <p><i>Se o estado de espírito que a causava era triste, não deixava por isso de ser doce.</i> – J. Sheridan Le Fanu, Carmilla (1872)</p>
      <p><i>Enlightenment is man’s emergence from his self-imposed subordination. Subordination is the inability to use one’s understanding without guidance from another. This subordination is self-imposed when its cause lies not in lack of understanding, but in lack of resolve and courage to use it without guidance from another. Sapere Aude! Have courage to use your own understanding! That is the motto of the Enlightenment.</i> – Immanuel Kant, What is Enlightenment? (1784)</p>
      <p><i>E finalmente a Kate, o meu último amor de juventude, o último e o mais grave, depois dela pode-se dizer que a minha juventude terminou, nunca mais conheci os estados mentais que normalmente associamos à juventude, aquela despreocupação encantadora, aquela sensação de um mundo indefinido e aberto. Depois dela a realidade fechou-se sobre mim, definitivamente.</i> – Michel Houellebecq, Serotonina (2019)</p>
      <p><i>Sometimes I wonder, and if I only had 6 months left to live, what would I do? And the brutality of the question is only matched by the brutality of the answer: I don't know.</i> – David Fernandes (2014)</p>
      <p><i>Nature is neither friend nor foe, neither malevolent nor benevolent. Nature is purposeless, Nature simply is. We may find nature beautiful or terrible, but those feelings are human constructions. The relationship between nature and us is one-sided, there is no reciprocity. We should not be concerned about protecting our planet: Nature can survive far more than what we can do to it and is totally oblivious to whether homo sapiens lives or dies. Our concern should be about protecting ourselves: because we have only ourselves to protect us.</i> – Alan Lightman (2014)</p>
      <p><i>Num certo momento, os velhos partidos europeus deixaram de tratar os seus eleitores como potenciais militantes, e passaram a tratá-los como uma espécie de consumidores, a quem prestam serviços por meio do Estado Social e da gestão da economia. Previsivelmente, os eleitores começaram a comportar-se como quaisquer consumidores, mudando de fornecedor quando o serviço não lhes parecia satisfatório.</i> – Rui Ramos (2015)</p>
      <p><i>The idea of zero tolerance is also informed by risk aversion. It represents an attempt to abolish, administratively, the risks associated with the expression of an unwelcome idea or belief. Of course, in one sense, tolerance is risky. Once conventional restraints on belief, opinion and speech are removed it becomes difficult to predict the future course of public life. The freedom to speak and to pursue knowledge has a habit of going off in unexpected directions.</i> – Frank Furedi, How Fear Works (2018)</p>
      <p><i>We are changing all the time. Moving between different aspects of self. We may have one aspect that wants to be more bold or subversive, which wrestles with our more agreeable, conflict-avoidant self. There is a constant negotiation occurring between these various aspects. And each time we tune in to a particular one, different choices result, changing the outcome of our work.</i> – Rick Rubin, The Creative Act (2023)</p>
      <p><i>Bicos, bocas, antenas e garras, olhos, escamas e patas, será de tal modo inato em nós o antropomorfismo que perante objetos mecânicos a nossa imediata tentação seja a de lhes atribuir partes orgânicas? Ou será que o antropomorfismo esteve deveras presente na mente dos engenheiros ao conceberem as máquinas, desenhando o seu funcionamento à imagem de um corpo?</i> – José Navarro de Andrade, Terra Firme (2014)</p>
      <p><i>Schism in the soul, schism in the body social, will not be resolved by any scheme of return to the good old days (archaism), or by programs guaranteed to render an ideal projected future (futurism), or even by the most realistic, hardheaded work to weld together again the deteriorating elements. Only birth can conquer death—the birth, not of the old thing again, but of something new.</i> – Joseph Campbell, The Hero With A Thousand Faces (1949)</p>
      <p><i>E tudo o que fiz, na verdade, não teve nenhum significado, nem sentido, pois trabalhei para os outros, não para mim.</i> – David Fernandes (2013)</p>
      <p><i>True, her temperament very often failed to comply, and declined to submit to the dictates of reason.</i> – Fyodor Dostoevsky, The Idiot (1869)</p>
      <p><i>She was a novelty, and it had become the thing to invite her to certain soirées, gorgeously attired and with her hair done up exhibition-style, and just sit her down like a beautiful picture to adorn the evening - just as other people borrow a picture, vase,  statue, or screen on the occasion of their own party.</i> – Fyodor Dostoevsky, The Idiot (1869)</p>
      <p><i>Em Madrid, pensava Robert Jordan, queria comprar alguns livros e pediria um quarto no Hotel Flórida e tomaria um banho bem quente. E mandaria Luís, o porteiro, procurar-me uma garrafa de absinto, se ainda as houver nas Mantequerías Leonesas ou em qualquer outro ponto perto da Gran Via, e ficaria deitado a ler, depois do banho, bebendo um ou dois absintos. E depois telefonaria para o Gaylord a fim de saber se poderia lá ir jantar.</i> – Ernest Hemingway, Por Quem os Sinos Dobram (1940)</p>
      <p><i>That was a special time: something new was afoot, something very unlike the tranquility of the past, and something very strange too, but which could be felt everywhere. Various rumors began to reach us. The facts were generally known, more or less, but it was obvious that apart from the facts there were certain ideas accompanying them, and, most importantly, a great number of them. But this is what was truly confusing: it proved utterly impossible to adapt to these ideas and find out exactly what they meant.</i> – Fyodor Dostoevsky, Demons (1871)</p>
      <p><i>Although everyone flatters developers, they are in high demand and salaries keep rising and rising, they feel less and less happy building stuff they don't understand, have no impact or that simply doesn't make sense. In an article an unknown engineer wrote "Then I worked for a tech giant, and then for a high-growth unicorn. It shocked me how dilbertesque they both were. Full of politicians and burnt out engineers in golden handcuffs who can't wait to get out, and meaningless business speak, and checked out employees who pretend they're excited about everything all the time."</i> – Stephan Schmidt (2020)</p>
      <p><i>The unusual European settlement, drawn up from ancient Greece and Rome, catalysed by the Christian religion and refined through the fire of the Enlightenments, turned out to be a highly particular inheritance.</i> – Douglas Murray, The Strange Death of Europe (2017)</p>
      <p><i>Que sei eu do que serei, eu que não sei o que sou?</i> – Fernando Pessoa, Tabacaria (1928)</p>
      <p><i>Some West African populations cut clearings in the rain forest to cultivate yams; as a result of more standing water, more malaria-carrying mosquitoes bread; malaria, in turn, increased the frequency of the gene for sickle cell anemia in the population, because this gene offers protection against malaria. So cutting down trees resulted in more people having sickle cell anemia. When we modify our environment, these modifications can bounce back to influence our biology and psychology.</i> – Anjan Chatterjee, The Aesthetic Brain (2013)</p>
      <p><i>Edward Snowden revealed that the Orwellian 1984’s Big Brother of the United States Empire is already watching you. And society responded with the indifference of Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451.</i> – David Fernandes (2016)</p>
      <p><i>If we are all rewriting our memories every time we recall an event, the memory exists not as a file in our brain but only as the most recent rewrite of a scenario. Every memoir is fabricated, and the past is nothing more than our last retelling of it. Archival memory data is mixed with whatever new information helps shape the way we think—and feel—about it. “My conclusion,” says Schiller, “is that memory is what you are now. Not in pictures, not in recordings. Your memory is who you are now.”</i> – Stephen S. Hall (2013)</p>
      <p><i>The president embarked on his first foreign trip with a clear eyed outlook that the world is not a ‘global community’ but an arena where nations, nongovernmental actors and businesses engage and compete for advantage.</i> – H. R. McMaster and Gary Cohn (2017)</p>
      <p><i>The Chettiar ethic is very much a Protestant ethic: work  hard, live very simply and earn as much profit as you can. The more profit you make means the more blessings you have from God. In accordance with the principle of Mahimai, a share of the profit is shared with God through contributions to religious and charitable work.</i> – Subbiah Lakshmanan</p>
      <p><i>Not all those who wander are lost.</i> – J. R. R. Tolkien</p>
      <p><i>Apenas me aconteceu ter uma inteligência naturalmente lúcida e uma vontade um tanto ou quanto forte.</i> – Fernando Pessoa, O Banqueiro Anarquista (1922)</p>
      <p><i>Cada geração deve reconhecer-se na sua Constituição. Se ela for ideologicamente construída e programaticamente datada, estamos a admitir que uma outra geração pensou por nós, para nós e em vez de nós.</i> – António Barreto (2015)</p>
      <p><i>The theoretical description of an algorithm can declare that certain things are simply assumed not to happen. However, a real implementation may still have to include code to handle the case where something happens that was assumed to be impossible, even if that handling boils down to printf("Fatal System Failure") and exit, letting a human operator clean up the mess. This is arguably the difference between computer science and software engineering.</i> – Martin Kleppmann, Designing Data-Intensive Applications (2017)</p>
      <p><i>Em a Crítica da Razão Negra (2014), Achille Mbembe enquadra o discurso Negro em três acontecimentos fundacionais: a escravatura, a colonização e a segregação.</i> – David Fernandes (2017)</p>
      <p><i>I have no graceful gestures, I have no sense of proportion; my words are inappropriate to my ideas, which devalues those ideas.</i> – Fyodor Dostoevsky, The Idiot (1869)</p>
      <p><i>I wanted to ask you, Mister Terentyev, whether what I've heard is true - you consider that you would only have to speak out of the window to the common people for quarter of an hour, for them to agree with you at once about everything and follow you immediately?</i> – Fyodor Dostoevsky, The Idiot (1869)</p>
      <p><i>Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.</i> – George Orwell, 1984 (1949)</p>
      <p><i>The first instalments of Tolstoy's War and Peace (1869), then titled The Year 1805, would appear side by side with the opening chapters of Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment (1866) in the same issue of The Russian Messenger (1866).</i> – David Fernandes (2024)</p>
      <p><i>A question that has since hung like a sword of Damocles over all knowledge, from the most trivial to the most advanced: How can we ever be justified in generalizing from what we've seen to what we haven't?</i> – Pedro Domingos, The Master Algorithm (2015)</p>
      <p><i>Thus a good learner is forever validating the narrow path between blindness and hallucination.</i> – Pedro Domingos, The Master Algorithm (2015)</p>
      <p><i>In Denmark the remains of Early Neolithic settlements on the banks of the lake have been preserved. The bog has good preservation conditions for animal bones and plant remains. The pollen from the bog strata shows how the vegetation changed after the arrival of the farmers, c. 4000 BC. Tree pollen was superseded by grain pollen and herb pollen when primeval forest was transformed into arable land.</i> – Nationalmuseet (2024)</p>
      <p><i>An organism that sees objective reality is always less fit than an organism of equal complexity that sees fitness payoffs. Seeing objective reality will make you extinct.</i> – Donald Hoffman</p>
      <p><i>Much of machine learning comes down to minimizing prediction error.</i> –  Anil Ananthaswamy</p>
      <p><i>Don't acknowledge fellow passengers or sustain eye contact beyond 2 seconds. Please respect urban solitude.</i> – London Underground (2012)</p>
      <p><i>"Destroy all carbon-based life forms" would be a very bad algorithm for autonomous killbots.</i> – US Army</p>
      <p><i>Imagine that you are your brain, locked inside the bony vault of the skull, trying to figure out what's out there in the world - a world that, from the perspective of the brain, also includes the body. All you have to go on are noisy and ambiguous sensory signals, which are only indirectly related to what's out there, and which certainly don't come with labels attached ("I'm from a cup of coffee! I'm from a  tree!"). Perception, in this view, has to be a process of inference - of neurally implemented probabilistic guesswork.</i> – Anil Seth</p>
      <p><i>Eu sou ocidental. A minha cultura é esta, não me interessam as outras. De que me vale a cultura asiática, a cultura africana? Respeito-as, mas não são a minha. Não ma podem substituir. A minha cultura é esta e eu sofro com ela.</i> – Arturo Pérez-Reverte (2016)</p>
      <p><i>Ivan Illich asked, “What can I do to survive in the midst of the show?”, before answering his own question with a proposed two-fold approach. First, he calls for “an ethics of vision”, which calls for us to “protect” our “imagination from overwhelming distraction, possibly leading to addiction”. Second, he suggests “ocular askesis”, a discipline by which we train ourselves to perceive the world as we wish to see it. Illich scholar L.M. Sacasas goes further: “Our task, then, would be to cultivate an ethos of seeing or new habits of vision. We should remember, that all the senses can be likewise trained.”</i> – Ashley Colby (2022)</p>
      <p><i>Michael Young’s “The Rise of the Meritocracy” argued that the most significant fact of modern society is not the rise of democracy, or indeed capitalism, but the rise of the meritocracy. In a knowledge society the most important influence on your life-chances is not your relationship with the means of production but your relationship with the machinery of educational and occupational selection.</i> – The Economist (2018)</p>
      <p><i>When writing up his researches on electrochemistry, Faraday was faced with a difficulty: he was trying to describe physical processes that nobody had described, or perhaps even though of, before. As his ideas grew, language itself became part of his thinking. He sought precision and faced a particular problem with words that were in common use but had misleading theoretical connotations; the prime example was current, which implied that electricity was a fluid. New words were needed not for their own sake but because existing ones carried theoretical baggage that could constrain one’s thinking.</i> – Nancy Forbes and Basil Mahon, Faraday, Maxwell, and the Electromagnetic Field (2014)</p>
      <p><i>Wabi-sabi is a concept in traditional Japanese aesthetics constituting a world view centered on the acceptance of transience and imperfection. The aesthetic is sometimes described as one of beauty that is “imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete.”</i> – Wikipedia (2017)</p>
      <p><i>Every year farmers send billions of gallons of water to other countries in the form of the food grown with that same water. The issue of agriculture's water footprint, all the water used to produce a commodity and get it to a consumer, is contentious since many farmers use scarce water to produce low-value export crops.</i> – National Geographic (2015)</p>
      <p><i>All you ever were was a little bit of the universe thinking to itself.</i> – Iain Banks, Surface Detail (2010)</p>
      <p><i>Someone studying atoms is just atoms trying to understand themselves.</i> – The Particle Adventure (2013)</p>
      <p><i>Fermions give rise to structure, they have stability and lead to life. We are formed from atoms that have existed for billions of years, it is only now that they are configured in combinations that think they are us. We breathe in oxygen, exhale carbon dioxide, grow and die, but our atoms will go on. Their basic pieces will recombine with infinite variety into the distant future.</i> – Frank Close, Antimatter (2009)</p>
