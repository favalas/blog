          Liberal candidate Nell Thomas, a family physician running for office in the riding of Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes (Canada), posted a video in which she said that “negative messages” on social media had been circulating about comments she made in the past that were “taken out of context.”
          Contacted by National Post, Thomas’s team did not immediately clarify which of her comments she was referring to, nor did she or her campaign specify which ones had been taken out of context.
          One screengrab circulating on social media shows Thomas, commenting on the “elderly demographic” on 2024, reportedly wrote that Canada must “stop keeping ancients alive so long.”
          Another screengrab of a post on X, dated 2023, shows Thomas reportedly criticizing women bearing children.
          “Imagine my thoughts when assessing a pregnant patient. I telepathically advise the fetus to sue the owner of the uterus while exiting it to this world. Of necessity, a mother must be a climate change denier,” reads the post.
          While Thomas did not specifically reference those posts in her apology video, she insisted that she is a “person of strong morality.”

          In Japan seven years ago, the central government began allowing city residents to divert a proportion of their income-tax payments to a furusato of their choice, a schema known as the furusato nozei, and the response has been overwhelming: in the last fiscal year rural towns earned $1.2 billion from such contributions. 
          Some city-dwellers still harbour strong feelings towards their furusato, or home town, that rural area which their forebears may have left many decades ago, but others choose a furusato simply because they like the area. Lucky rural towns, suffering financially as a result of ageing and shrinking, are especially delighted as the furusato nozei is proving a windfall.

          The scene was a lagoon on the shore of Lake Turkana in Kenya. 
          The time about 10,000 years ago. One group of hunter-gatherers attacked and slaughtered another, leaving the dead with crushed skulls, embedded arrow or spear points, and other devastating wounds. 
          A woman was killed by a blow to the head and the position of her hands and feet suggest that she may have been tied up before she was killed. 
          Violence has always been part of human behavior, but the origins of war are hotly debated. 
          Some experts see it as deeply rooted in evolution, others emphasize the influence of complex and hierarchical human societies. 
          No one is suggesting that this discovery will settle this argument, but it may be the first instance of a massacre in a foraging society.

          The job as we think of it today is a relatively modern invention. 
          It protects you from the daily ups and downs of business. 
          So if you're working in an office as a graphic designer for Coca Cola or you're a shipping clerk for some stationary manufacturer, you don't wake up every morning and find out based on the weather or based on the market whether you have a job that day or not. 
          You have a long-term commitment that obviously can change, but you have this buffering, this safety from the chaos of the marketplace. 
          And also in the modern job you don't have to be proving worth all the time. 
          You maybe don't have your best performing day or week, month, but you're not going to get fired. 
          You just go in, put in your hours and you're still going to get paid. There is decades of fascinating studies of how expensive it is for companies to actually monitor each worker. 
          It's really efficient not to make sure each worker is maximally efficient: you just hire a whole bunch of people and figure some will work really hard, some won't work at all and most people will be somewhere in the middle.

          Greece is $380 billion is debt. 
          For the last few years, amidst her financial crisis, Greece has flirted with the idea of selling off state historical assets. 
          The UK should ease Greece's debt problem and buy (the rest of) the Parthenon. 
          Britain could offer an enormous (many-billion-pound) cash payment, along with an even larger, very-low interest loan, for which the British government could surely get extensive private sponsorship. 
          Very far-fetched, perhaps, but there is some precedent. 
          It wouldn't be the first such structure to find its way to a museum. 
          The Pergamon Museum in Berlin has the massive Pergamon altar from an acropolis in Asia Minor and the Ishtar gate from Ancient Babylon. 
          The Metropolitan Museum in New York has an entire Roman-period Egyptian temple named Dendur, brought to Manhattan from the banks of the Nile. 
          The Parthenon would obviously be a big step up, but not an altogether incomprehensible one. 
          It could be safely displayed in a new, gigantic gallery of the British Museum, and make it an even more popular tourist attraction.

          Em 1988, Philip Tetlock, um jovem psicólogo canadiano, lembrou-se de contactar mais de 200 pessoas em todo o mundo, todas elas especialistas de grande reputação em temas políticos e económicos. 
          Ao longo de 15 anos, colocou-lhes perguntas sobre esses temas, pedindo-lhes que atribuíssem probabilidades a diferentes cenários sobre o futuro próximo. 
          Quem iria ganhar as próximas eleições nos seus países? Que evoluções antecipavam para uma série de indicadores económicos? 
          Que conflitos militares deveríamos esperar? 
          Em 2005, Tetlock apresentou os resultados desta singular experiência no livro Expert Political Judgment. 
          A principal conclusão? 
          Em média, a capacidade destes especialistas para preverem o futuro próximo nas matérias que dominam é semelhante à de um chimpanzé a atirar dardos a um alvo. 
          A quem quiser igualar o desempenho médio de alguns dos maiores especialistas mundiais em matérias políticas e económicas basta-lhe dar palpites à sorte. 
          É difícil não olhar para ele como uma denúncia do espaço comunicacional em países como os Estados Unidos ou, por exemplo, Portugal: um espaço onde pululam “especialistas” e “profetas” que nos comunicam convictamente todo o tipo de certezas, sendo depois recompensados mais pelo seu “valor de entretenimento” do que pela precisão das suas afirmações.

          Attempts to build a multicultural society in Germany have “utterly failed”, Chancellor Angela Merkel says. She said the so-called “multikulti” concept, where people would “live side-by-side” happily, did not work, and immigrants needed to do more to integrate, including learning German. 
          Mrs Merkel told a gathering of younger members of her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party on Saturday that at “the beginning of the 60s our country called the foreign workers to come to Germany and now they live in our country. 
          We kidded ourselves a while, we said: ‘They won’t stay, sometime they will be gone’, but this isn’t reality.” 
          There has been intense debate about multiculturalism in Germany in recent months. 
          Earlier this week, Horst Seehofer, the leader of the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, the CSU, said it was “obvious that immigrants from different cultures like Turkey and Arab countries, all in all, find it harder” to integrate. “‘Multikulti’ is dead,” Mr Seehofer said.
