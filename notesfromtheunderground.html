          Liberal candidate Nell Thomas, a family physician running for office in the riding of Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes (Canada), posted a video in which she said that “negative messages” on social media had been circulating about comments she made in the past that were “taken out of context.”
          Contacted by National Post, Thomas’s team did not immediately clarify which of her comments she was referring to, nor did she or her campaign specify which ones had been taken out of context.
          One screengrab circulating on social media shows Thomas, commenting on the “elderly demographic” on 2024, reportedly wrote that Canada must “stop keeping ancients alive so long.”
          Another screengrab of a post on X, dated 2023, shows Thomas reportedly criticizing women bearing children.
          “Imagine my thoughts when assessing a pregnant patient. I telepathically advise the fetus to sue the owner of the uterus while exiting it to this world. Of necessity, a mother must be a climate change denier,” reads the post.
          While Thomas did not specifically reference those posts in her apology video, she insisted that she is a “person of strong morality.”

          In Japan seven years ago, the central government began allowing city residents to divert a proportion of their income-tax payments to a furusato of their choice, a schema known as the furusato nozei, and the response has been overwhelming: in the last fiscal year rural towns earned $1.2 billion from such contributions. 
          Some city-dwellers still harbour strong feelings towards their furusato, or home town, that rural area which their forebears may have left many decades ago, but others choose a furusato simply because they like the area. Lucky rural towns, suffering financially as a result of ageing and shrinking, are especially delighted as the furusato nozei is proving a windfall.

          The scene was a lagoon on the shore of Lake Turkana in Kenya. 
          The time about 10,000 years ago. One group of hunter-gatherers attacked and slaughtered another, leaving the dead with crushed skulls, embedded arrow or spear points, and other devastating wounds. 
          A woman was killed by a blow to the head and the position of her hands and feet suggest that she may have been tied up before she was killed. 
          Violence has always been part of human behavior, but the origins of war are hotly debated. 
          Some experts see it as deeply rooted in evolution, others emphasize the influence of complex and hierarchical human societies. 
          No one is suggesting that this discovery will settle this argument, but it may be the first instance of a massacre in a foraging society.
