          Modernity cannot be identified with any particular technological or social breakthrough. Rather, it is a subjective condition, a feeling or an intuition that we are in some profound sense different from the people who lived before us.

          The <i>quantum protectorate</i> describes a stable state of matter whose generic properties are determined by a higher organising principle and nothing else. The very large number of atoms present in real bits of matter lead to fundamentally new types of behaviour which are not just simply the properties of an individual atom multiplied by the number of atoms. Different behaviour occurs when you have more.

          Make two marks on your mirror on a level with your eyes, and think of them as two human eyes looking into yours. 
          Do not move your head, but stand erect. Concentrate all your thoughts on keeping your head perfectly still. 
          Do not let another thought come into your mind. Then, still keeping the head, eyes and body still, think that you look like a reliable man or woman should; like a person that anyone would have confidence in. 
          While standing before the mirror practice deep breathing. 
          The one that stands up like a man and has control over the muscles of his face and eyes always commands attention.
          <br /><br />
          Also, sit in a comfortable chair and see how still you can keep. 
          This is not as easy as it seems. 
          You will have to center your attention on sitting still. 
          Watch and see that you are not making any involuntary muscular movements. 
          By a little practice you will find you are able to sit still without a movement of the muscles for fifteen minutes. 
          At first I advise sitting in a relaxed position for five minutes. 
          After you are able to keep perfectly still, increase the time to ten minutes and then to fifteen. 
          This is as long as it is necessary. 
          But never strain yourself to keep still. 
          You must be relaxed completely.

          I regard the whole Northwestern United States to be among the global hubs of our present derangements. 
          This week it emerged that Seattle 's school board has decided even maths must be subjected to the same numbing and unthinking orthodoxy of our time. 
          In particular that mathematics must – like everything else – be seen through the prism of racism and oppression. 
          Thus as the Seattle Public Schools guidelines for maths education show, students in Seattle schools will be invited to consider questions such as "Where does Power and Oppression show up in our math experience?" or "How has math been used to resist and liberate people and communities of color from oppression?" 
          The cleverer students will realise that there is a "correct" answer to the questions, whether or not those answers are true – as there is to every other question of our age. 
          They'll work out that the answer to every question posed by the Seattle authorities will always and everywhere be the same: "more diversity". 
          <i>But the problem is not with the smarter students, who like most smart people will always find a way to navigate around the lies and dogmas of their age, but the less intelligent applicants.</i> 
          A rather basic knowledge of maths would help such people and come in very handy in their lives: in ordering their finances, and working out their day-to-day interactions with others. 
          If they do not pick up these basics at school, then it is highly unlikely that they will pick them up at some later stage, the education system offering the best chance anyone ever has to surpass their forebears. 
          How disturbing it is to learn that instead, even in a discipline like maths, students will be cocooned and imprisoned in the lies of their age rather than being given the chance to escape them.
