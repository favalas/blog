          Michel Houellebecq's sixth novel, Soumission, was published today, <i>January the 7th</i>, in France. 
          According to it, the leader of France's Muslim party has beaten the far-right Front National in the Presidential election, women abandon Western dress and leave work, non-Muslim teachers are forced out of their jobs and polygamy is reinstated: this is France in 2022. 
          When confronted with accusations of Islamophobia, Houellebecq claimed that he was not writing out of fear and that "things don't go all that badly" in the book, except if you were a "feminist".

          Also today, <i>January the 7th</i>, at least 12 people have been killed in a shooting incident at the Paris office of French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo. 
          Video footage posted to social media showed armed gunmen running through the streets of Paris, shooting with automatic weapons and shouting "Allahu Akbar". 
          According to an eye-witness, one of the gunmen shouted: "The Prophet is avenged."

          "I accelerate history, but no, I can't say that the book is a provocation; if that means saying things I consider fundamentally untrue just to get on people's nerves. I condense an evolution that is, in my opinion, realistic."

          Na primeira década do século XXI, o PIB per capita da Área Metropolitana de Lisboa (AML) havia baixado de um índice que se aproximava dos 120 no ano 2000 (face uma média de 100 de todas as regiões da UE) para 116 em 2010. 
          Mas no decurso da segunda década, este indicador irá baixar de forma acentuada, passando para um nível próximo de 100 em 2017. 
          Os dados provisórios mais recentes mostram, contudo, perspetivas de uma ténue melhoria para os anos de 2018 e de 2019 (com um índice de cerca de 101 e de 102, respetivamente). 
          Portanto, a AML apresenta desde o inicio do século uma trajetória de divergência face ao crescimento económico médio das regiões europeias. 
          O que, a par de uma aproximação aos níveis médios das restantes regiões portuguesas, fez com que no documento Estratégias AML para 2030 se denominasse esta trajetória de «um processo de coesão de convergência não virtuoso».

          [A Futile Struggle]
          <br/><br/>
          After more than 30 years of liberal and libertarian political activity, including personal contacts with federal ministers, the following became clear to me: my classic liberal/liberal convictions that freedom, self-determination but also personal responsibility are the values that enable a life of prosperity and satisfaction are not shared by the majority. 
          Nowhere, in any system, not even in the USA or Switzerland.
          It is therefore a futile love struggle to convince democratic societies of the merits of these values. 
          Those who promise free services, redistribution and extensive social security will always win the elections. 
          Always and everywhere. Over time, this will lead to exploding national debt, over-regulation, incapacitation and infantilization of citizens. 
          Such long-term considerations, however, do not usually play a role in election decisions. 
          Liberal or libertarian parties must therefore also transform themselves into redistributive parties if they want to survive in democracies. 
          After a certain period of time, they can hardly be distinguished from their competitors.

          The word "paradise" entered English from an Old Iranian form, "walled enclosure". 
          By the 6th/5th century BCE, the Old Iranian word had been borrowed into Assyrian. 
          It subsequently came to indicate the expansive walled gardens of the First Persian Empire, and was subsequently borrowed into Hebrew as "pardes" and into Greek as "parádeisos", park for animals. 
          In the Septuagint (3rd–1st centuries BCE), Greek "parádeisos" was used to translate both Hebrew "pardes" and Hebrew "gan" (garden): it is from this usage that the use of "paradise" to refer to the Garden of Eden derives.
