          Michel Houellebecq's sixth novel, Soumission, was published today, <i>January the 7th</i>, in France. 
          According to it, the leader of France's Muslim party has beaten the far-right Front National in the Presidential election, women abandon Western dress and leave work, non-Muslim teachers are forced out of their jobs and polygamy is reinstated: this is France in 2022. 
          When confronted with accusations of Islamophobia, Houellebecq claimed that he was not writing out of fear and that "things don't go all that badly" in the book, except if you were a "feminist".

          Also today, <i>January the 7th</i>, at least 12 people have been killed in a shooting incident at the Paris office of French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo. 
          Video footage posted to social media showed armed gunmen running through the streets of Paris, shooting with automatic weapons and shouting "Allahu Akbar". 
          According to an eye-witness, one of the gunmen shouted: "The Prophet is avenged."

          Na primeira década do século XXI, o PIB per capita da Área Metropolitana de Lisboa (AML) havia baixado de um índice que se aproximava dos 120 no ano 2000 (face uma média de 100 de todas as regiões da UE) para 116 em 2010. 
          Mas no decurso da segunda década, este indicador irá baixar de forma acentuada, passando para um nível próximo de 100 em 2017. 
          Os dados provisórios mais recentes mostram, contudo, perspetivas de uma ténue melhoria para os anos de 2018 e de 2019 (com um índice de cerca de 101 e de 102, respetivamente). 
          Portanto, a AML apresenta desde o inicio do século uma trajetória de divergência face ao crescimento económico médio das regiões europeias. 
          O que, a par de uma aproximação aos níveis médios das restantes regiões portuguesas, fez com que no documento Estratégias AML para 2030 se denominasse esta trajetória de «um processo de coesão de convergência não virtuoso».

          [A Futile Struggle]
          <br/><br/>
          After more than 30 years of liberal and libertarian political activity, including personal contacts with federal ministers, the following became clear to me: my classic liberal/liberal convictions that freedom, self-determination but also personal responsibility are the values that enable a life of prosperity and satisfaction are not shared by the majority. 
          Nowhere, in any system, not even in the USA or Switzerland.
          It is therefore a futile love struggle to convince democratic societies of the merits of these values. 
          Those who promise free services, redistribution and extensive social security will always win the elections. 
          Always and everywhere. Over time, this will lead to exploding national debt, over-regulation, incapacitation and infantilization of citizens. 
          Such long-term considerations, however, do not usually play a role in election decisions. 
          Liberal or libertarian parties must therefore also transform themselves into redistributive parties if they want to survive in democracies. 
          After a certain period of time, they can hardly be distinguished from their competitors.

          The word "paradise" entered English from an Old Iranian form, meaning "walled enclosure". 
          By the 6th/5th century BCE, the Old Iranian word had been borrowed into Assyrian. 
          It subsequently came to indicate the expansive walled gardens in the First Persian Empire, and was subsequently borrowed into Hebrew as "pardes" and into Greek as "parádeisos", park for animals. 
          In the Septuagint (3rd–1st centuries BCE), Greek "parádeisos" was used to translate both Hebrew "pardes" and Hebrew "gan" (garden): it is from this usage that the use of "paradise" to refer to the Garden of Eden derives.

          <i>Pale males</i> are the last group it’s OK to vilify. I am hideously white. 
          The BBC was called hideously white by its former boss Greg Dyke, and the West End stage hideously white by Andrew Lloyd Webber. 
          This week the Football Association was dismissed by critics as a bunch of “old white men”. 
          Note that it is not the BBC or the theater that is hideous, but their whiteness. 
          Such are the routine humiliations of my group. 
          Fashion in collective abuse seeks comfort in crowds. 
          In choosing pale males for ritual contempt, identity politics has found a target that it hopes will confess its “guilt”. 
          Were someone such as I to take offence, demand redress or protected space, I would be bidden to shut up, get a life and not be so sensitive. 
          I might turn to Kant and universalize the judgment. 
          What if I were to follow “hideously” with black, female, Jewish, Arab, obese, disabled or Welsh? 
          I doubt there are many selection panels that do not instinctively mark down any pale male applicant. 
          The chair begins: “Yes, he may the best candidate, but…” 
          And the gods of discrimination look down from on high and wag a stern finger. 
          “White males” cruise the jobcentres and head-hunters like ancient sharks, as if looking for a quiet beach on which to die.

          <small>[review of the book Fahrenheit 451 (1953), by Ray Bradbury]</small>
          A society can be a dystopia and doesn't know it: maybe, it doesn't even care! Montag, Fahrenheit's improbable hero, isn't concern with some ruthless political elite, he just wants to rouse his wife, himself and ultimately, his technologically advanced community, from theirs intellectual alienation. 
          His awakening is a thrilling story, full of powerful metaphors and a perfect climax. 
          Ray Bradbury's novel has a chilling resemblance to today's screen obsessed civilization.

          [Quotes from Fahrenheit 451]
          <br/><br/>
          <i>More pictures. The mind drinks less and less. Impatience. Highways full of crowds going somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, nowhere.</i>
          <br/><br/>
          <i>Cram them full of non-combustible data, chock them so damned full of "facts" they feel stuffed, but absolutely "brilliant" with information. Then they'll feel they're thinking, they'll get a sense of motion without moving.</i>
          <br/><br/>
          <i>The folly of mistaking a metaphor for a proof, a torrent of verbiage for a spring of capital truths, and oneself as an oracle, is inborn in us, Mr Valéry once said.</i>

          [Survivorship Bias]
          <br/><br/>
          The Statistical Research Group, where Abraham Wald spent much of World War II, was a classified program that yoked the assembled might of American statisticians to the war effort:  something like the Manhattan Project, except the weapons being developed were equations, not explosives. 
          The military came to the SRG with some data they thought might be useful. 
          When American planes came back from engagements over Europe, they were covered in bullet holes. 
          But the damage wasn't uniformly distributed across the aircraft. 
          There were more bullet holes in the fuselage, not so many in the engines. 
          The officers saw an opportunity for efficiency; you can get the same protection with less armor if you concentrate the armor on the places with the greatest need, where the planes are getting hit the most. 
          But exactly how much more armor belonged on those parts of the plane? That was the answer they came to Wald for. 
          It wasn't the answer they got.
          <br/><br/>
          The armor, said Wald, doesn't go where the bullet holes are. 
          It goes where the bullet holes aren't: on the engines. 
          Wald's insight was simply to ask: where are the missing holes? 
          The ones that would have been all over the engine casing, if the damage had been spread equally all over the plane? 
          Wald was pretty sure he knew. 
          The missing bullet holes were on the missing planes. 
          The reason planes were coming back with fewer hits to the engine is that planes that got hit in the engine weren't coming back. 
          Whereas the large number of planes returning to base with a thoroughly Swiss-cheesed fuselage is pretty strong evidence that hits to the fuselage can (and therefore should) be tolerated. 
          To a mathematician, the structure underlying the bullet hole problem is a phenomenon called survivorship bias.
