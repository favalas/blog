      <h1>Notes From The Underground - II</h1>
      <p>
          In 1913, Vienna played host to Adolf Hitler, Leon Trotsky, Joseph Tito, Sigmund Freud and Joseph Stalin. 
          It was a disparate group. The two revolutionaries, Stalin and Trotsky, were on the run. Sigmund Freud was already well established. 
          The psychoanalyst, exalted by followers as the man who opened up the secrets of the mind, lived and practised on the city’s Berggasse. 
          The young Josip Broz, later to find fame as Yugoslavia’s leader Marshal Tito, worked at the Daimler automobile factory in Wiener Neustadt, a town south of Vienna. 
          Then there was the 24-year-old from the north-west of Austria whose dreams of studying painting at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts had been twice dashed and who now lodged in a doss-house in Meldermannstrasse near the Danube, one Adolf Hitler. 
          No-one knows if Hitler bumped into Trotsky, or Tito met Stalin. The conflagration which erupted the following year destroyed much of Vienna’s intellectual life. 
          The empire imploded in 1918, while propelling Hitler, Stalin, Trotsky and Tito into careers that would mark world history forever.

          Mark Oleynik hopes to change the home kitchen by introducing a robot cook that is as good as a top chef but which can be installed in all houses. 
          It can, in principle, be used to cook more or less anything: a pair of dexterous robotic hands suspended from the ceiling assemble the ingredients, mix them, and cook them in pots and pans as required, on a hob or in an oven. 
          A prototype of the idea, unveiled in Hanover, has been demonstrating its culinary prowess in public, by whipping up an excellent crab bisque. 
          The machine's finesse comes because its hands, human-sized and with jointed fingers and thumbs, are copying the actions of a particular human chef, who has cooked the recipe specially in order to provide a template for the robot to copy. 
          The plan is to support the automated kitchen with an online library of more than 2,000 recipes.

          I remember being rather disturbed by the sad and lonely little knots of abortion opponents we sometimes encountered at demonstrations – often hollow-faced men with severe hair and very tightly-tied ties, standing in the rain next to some glum nuns. 
          They perfectly encapsulated what we were fleeing from, the ordered, hierarchical, self-disciplined life of the suburbs, lawn-mowing, shoe-polishing, respectable, possibly even church-going. 
          What if we were all to be dragged back into that world, compelled by a bawling baby to take out a mortgage, live in the provinces, become a commuter, sing hymns and acquire a garden gate?
          No, we were destined to live in the capital, child-free, lawn-free, hymn-free, unencumbered, without obligations to our parents, and the past, or to children, and the future.

          The hammer-wielding terrorist who attacked police outside the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris was handed an award by the European Union for complaining about racism against migrants. 
          Farid Ikken, 40, emerged from a crowd of tourists and swinging his weapon at three police officers. 
          Now it has emerged that he had worked as a reporter in Sweden and received the EU's 'National Journalist Prize Against Discrimination'. 
          He was given the accolade by officials in Brussels after writing an article about asylum seekers 'who are not entitled to medical care and who are therefore forced to seek shelter'. 
          After winning the prize in 2009, Ikken said: 'it has been gratifying that attention has been paid to such important topics as discrimination and diversity.' 
          Ikken had studied at Stockholm university, and is thought to have married a Swedish woman during his time there. 
          He is currently enrolled as a doctoral student specialising in communication at Metz university, in eastern France.

          In Christianity, the doctrine of the Trinity states that God is a single essence in which three distinct hypostases ("persons"): the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, exists consubstantially and co-eternally as a perichoresis. 
          Islam considers the concept of any "plurality" within God to be a denial of monotheism. Monotheism in Islam, known as Tawhid, is the religion's central and single most important concept, upon which a Muslim's entire religious adherence rests. 
          Shirk, the act of ascribing partners to God – whether they be sons, daughters, or other partners – is considered to be a form of unbelief in Islam. 
          The Quran repeatedly and firmly asserts God's absolute oneness, thus ruling out the possibility of another being sharing his sovereignty or nature: "There is no god except God."

          Whereas black studies celebrates black writers and black history, and gay studies brings out gay figures from history and pushes them to the fore, ‘whiteness studies’ is far from a celebratory study. 
          Its aim is that it is committed to disrupting racism by problematizing whiteness. 
          So whereas every other field of race studies is performed in a spirit of celebration the aim of this one must be to ‘problematize’ hundreds and hundreds of millions of people. 
          Of course it might be said that defining an entire group of people, their attitudes, pitfalls and moral associations, based solely on their racial characteristics is itself a fairly good demonstration of racism. 
          For ‘whiteness’ to be problematized’ white people must be shown to be a problem.

          I arrived in London at April, 2015. Strolling around its streets and travelling through its underground, I noticed that no culture or ethnicity was in majority. 
          Its roots are British and it's inside England but London is London nowadays, a city-state in its own right. 
          With more than thirteen million metropolitan inhabitants, it is preforming the unique experience of forging the ultimate Humanist utopia: despite your race, culture or religion, you are a Londoner and London is your home. 
          It justifies its own existence not on ethnic or historical grounds, but pragmatic needs, like the availability of a Costa Coffee, a Primark or a H&M near you; united in consumerism.
          Although it seems that everyone is getting along, it is also true that London is putting a tremendous amount of effort and money in an Orwellian rewriting of its own White and British History: whether in pro-immigration campaigns or in social engineering of its television shows, racial fairness is not taken lightly. 
          Its museums highlight "the first Black", "the first Muslim" and even "found" a black Roman centurion. 
          I admire the courage of London performing such social experience but I wonder if all its communities will stand together if someday London experiences an economic doom and if yes, what will be the glue that holds them.

          “Harrison Bergeron” is a dystopian science-fiction short story by American writer Kurt Vonnegut, first published in October 1961. 
          In the year 2081, the 211th, 212th, and 213th amendments to the Constitution dictate that all Americans are fully equal and not allowed to be smarter, better-looking or more physically able than anyone else. 
          The Handicapper General’s agents enforce the equality laws, forcing citizens to wear “handicaps”: masks for those who are too beautiful, loud radios that disrupt thoughts inside the ears of intelligent people and heavy weights for the strong or athletic. (2020)

          [Hedgehog's Dilemma]
          A number of porcupines huddled together for warmth on a cold day in winter; but, as they began to prick one another with their quills, they were obliged to disperse. 
          However the cold drove them together again, when just the same thing happened. 
          At last, after many turns of huddling and dispersing, they discovered that they would be best off by remaining at a little distance from one another. 
          In the same way the need of society drives humans together, only to be mutually repelled by the many prickly and disagreeable qualities of their nature. 
          The moderate distance which they at last discover to be the only tolerable condition of intercourse, is the code of politeness and fine manners; and those who transgress it are roughly told to keep their distance. 
          By this arrangement the mutual need of warmth is only very moderately satisfied; but then people do not get pricked.
          Arthur Schopenhauer conceived this metaphor for the state of the individual in society.

          [Samuel Paty died. For what?]
          French president Emmanuel Macron paid his respects at the coffin of History teacher Samuel Paty, who was beheaded for having shown cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in a civics class discussion on free speech at the junior high school where he taught in the suburb of Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, near Paris. 
          He was killed on his way home from work after school by  Abdullakh Anzorov, who published an image of the teacher's severed head on Twitter before he was himself shot dead by police. 
          The president said Paty was slain "because he incarnated the French Republic." 
          Macron gave the country's highest civilian award, the Legion of Honour, to Samuel Paty. (2020)

          Most of Iraq’s Christians call themselves Assyrians, Chaldeans or Syriac, different names for a common ethnicity rooted in the Mesopotamian kingdoms that flourished between the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers thousands of years before Jesus. 
          Christianity arrived during the first century, according to Eusebius, an early church historian. 
          From Greece to Egypt, this was the eastern half of Christendom, a fractious community divided by doctrinal differences that persist today: various Catholic churches, the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox, and the Assyrian Church of the East. 
          When the first Islamic armies arrived from the Arabian Peninsula during the seventh century, the Assyrian Church of the East was sending missionaries to China, India and Mongolia. 
          The shift from Christianity to Islam happened gradually. Much as the worship of Eastern cults largely gave way to Christianity, Christianity gave way to Islam. 
          For 1,500 years, different religions thrived side by side. 
          One hundred years ago, the fall of the Ottoman Empire and World War I ushered in the greatest period of violence against Christians in the region. 
          The genocide waged by the Turks left at least two million Armenians, Assyrians and Greeks dead. Nearly all were Christian. 
          From 1910 to 2010, the percentage of the Middle Eastern population that was Christian continued to decline: once 14 percent of the population, Christians now make up roughly 4 percent. 
          In Lebanon, the only country in the region where Christians hold significant political power, their numbers have shrunk over the past century, to 34 percent from 78 percent of the population. 
          Low birthrates have contributed to this decline, as well as hostile political environments and economic crisis. Fear is also a driver. 
          The rise of extremist groups, as well as the perception that their communities are vanishing, causes people to leave.

          Did you take part in any of the mysterious commemorations last weekend? 
          The newspapers were full of it – something called 7/7, apparently. 
          I read a long report on the BBC’s website about this tragedy but remained entirely unclear as to who killed the people on those trains and bus. 
          The report said ‘bombs were detonated’ on the Tube, as if the bombs – anxious to fulfil their purpose in life – had blown themselves up, without the aid of any external agency. 
          Nowhere in the report did it mention who brought the bombs down from Yorkshire and then set them off. 
          Nowhere in the entire article were the words ‘Islam’ or ‘Islamist’ or even ‘Muslim’ mentioned, nor even the names of the murderers. 
          It was as if they were coincidental to the atrocity, and not worthy of consideration. 
          Mind you, a day later there was a piece explaining how 7/7 had changed the lives of British Muslims and had made them less trustful of the white community.

          The Library of Babel is a short story written by Argentine author Jorge Luis Borges and was published in 1941. 
          The library comprises a gigantic collection of books, each having 410 pages, with 40 lines on each page and 80 characters on each line. 
          Thus, there are 410 x 40 x 80 = 1,312,000 characters in each book. 
          The library contains every possible book of this form, that is, one book with each of the possible orderings of the characters. 
          Borges used an alphabet of 25 letters, so the total number of books is 25 raised to the power 1,312,000. 
          This corresponds approximately to two followed by 1.8 million zeros, an unfathomable number. 
          Thus, it would contain every book that ever has been written, and every book that ever could be, including every play, every song, every scientific paper, every legal decision, every constitution, every piece of scripture, and so on. (2019)

          Unlike the Nazi genocide, much of the killing in Galicia in Eastern Europe took place between neighbour and neighbour: Jews, Poles and Ukrainians destroyed each other with increasing ferocity and brutality between 1914 and the 1940s. 
          The beautiful city of Buczacz in Eastern Galicia, with its Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Jewish shrines, ended as a gigantic ruin. 
          Omer Bartov, the distinguished military historian, came from a family that had lived in Buczacz but emigrated to Israel. 
          He begins by explaining that the Jews did not live segregated from the Christian population; the entire notion of a shtetl existing in some sort of splendid (or sordid) isolation is merely a figment of Jewish literary and folkloristic imagination. 
          Integration was what made the existence of such towns possible. 
          It was also what made the genocide there, when it occurred, a communal event, both cruel and intimate, filled with gratuitous violence and betrayal as well as flashes of altruism and kindness.

          The Fixed Period has been so far discussed as to make it almost unnecessary for me to explain its tenets, though its advantages may require a few words of argument in a world that is at present dead to its charms. 
          It consists altogether of the abolition of the miseries, weakness, and fainéant imbecility of old age, by the prearranged ceasing to live of those who would otherwise become old. 
          Need I explain how extreme are those sufferings, and how great the costliness of that old age which is unable in any degree to supply its own wants? 
          Such old age should not be allowed to be. 
          This should be prevented, in the interests both of the young and of those who do become old when obliged to linger on after their “period” of work is over. 
          Oh, it is an adamantine law to protect the human race from the imbecility, the weakness, the discontent, and the extravagance of old age!

          In my new book, Supernormal Stimuli: How Primal Urges Overran Their Evolutionary Purpose, I describe how human instincts, for food, sex, or territorial protection, developed for life on the Savannah 10,000 years ago, not today's world of densely populated cities and technological innovations. 
          Evolution has been unable to keep pace with the rapid changes of modern life. 
          In the 1930s Dutch Nobel laureate Niko Tinbergen found that birds that lay small, pale blue eggs speckled with grey preferred to sit on giant, bright blue plaster dummies with black polka dots. 
          He coined the term "supernormal stimuli" to describe these imitations that appeal to primitive instincts and, oddly, exert a stronger attraction than real things. 
          We humans can produce our own supernormal stimuli: candy, pornography, huge-eyed stuffed animals. 
          The concept of Supernormal Stimuli has enormous power to illuminate the alarming disconnect between human instinct and our created environment.

          Guys, unless you are really hot you are probably better off not wasting your time on Tinder. 
          This study was conducted to quantify the Tinder socio-economic prospects for males based on the percentage of females that will "like" them. 
          It was determined that the bottom 80% of men (in terms of attractiveness) are competing for the bottom 22% of women and the top 78% of women are competing for the top 20% of men. 
          In addition, it was determined that a man of average attractiveness would be "liked" by approximately 0.87% (1 in 115) of women on Tinder.

          Vítor Constâncio recusa-se a responder perante os deputados da Comissão de Inquérito ao Banif. 
          O vice-governador do Banco Central Europeu justifica a opção, dizendo que a instituição com sede em Frankfurt não “presta contras” aos parlamentos nacionais. 
          Apenas ao “Parlamento Europeu”.

          O Presidente da República desvalorizou as críticas do Conselho de Finanças Públicas. 
          Para Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa a palavra que importa é de Bruxelas, já que “o Conselho de Finanças Públicas [que duvida das contas do Governo] é um órgão muito importante, mas verdadeiramente importante é a Comissão Europeia”.

          O Benfica foi o primeiro clube português a ganhar um grande troféu na Europa, a Taça dos Clubes Campeões Europeus em 1961 e 1962 (e perdeu as finais de 1963, 1965, 1968, 1988 e 1990 - em 1983 perdeu a final da Taça UEFA e em 2013 e 2014 as finais da Liga Europa). 
          O Benfica era “O” clube português na Europa, a bandeira de Portugal, o que ajuda a explicar o enorme apoio vermelho de norte a sul de Portugal, nas ilhas e também nas colónias africanas (até 1975 e depois). 
          Este estatuto do Benfica começou a ser disputado pelo Futebol Clube do Porto ao ganhar a sua Taça dos Clubes Campeões Europeus em 1987 e no século XXI ao torna-se mesmo no clube com mais sucesso internacional em Portugal ao ganhar a Taça UEFA (2003), a Liga dos Campeões (2004) e a Liga Europa (2011). 
          Como consequência, o estatuto do Benfica como o clube de Portugal na Europa é agora partilhado, e disputado, com o Porto. 
          A hegemonia do Benfica na Europa era refletida também a nível nacional até ao início do século XXI: em 1991 tinha 29 títulos de campeão nacional de futebol e o Porto 11. Em 2022, o Benfica tem 37 títulos e o Porto 30. 
          O crescimento do Porto quer na Europa, quer em Portugal, coloca agora o mesmo como clube que se projeta a nível nacional e não apenas no Porto e no Norte, a raiz histórica da sua identidade. 
          A ascensão do Porto em Portugal e na Europa tem mesmo um paralelismo com a ascensão do Benfica até 1990.
