      <h1>Notes From The Underground - II</h1>
      <p>
          TODELETE : Liberal candidate Nell Thomas, a family physician running for office in the riding of Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes (Canada), posted a video in which she said that “negative messages” on social media had been circulating about comments she made in the past that were “taken out of context.”
          Contacted by National Post, Thomas’s team did not immediately clarify which of her comments she was referring to, nor did she or her campaign specify which ones had been taken out of context.
          One screengrab circulating on social media shows Thomas, commenting on the “elderly demographic” on 2024, reportedly wrote that Canada must “stop keeping ancients alive so long.”
          Another screengrab of a post on X, dated 2023, shows Thomas reportedly criticizing women bearing children.
          “Imagine my thoughts when assessing a pregnant patient. I telepathically advise the fetus to sue the owner of the uterus while exiting it to this world. Of necessity, a mother must be a climate change denier,” reads the post.
          While Thomas did not specifically reference those posts in her apology video, she insisted that she is a “person of strong morality.”
